Add capabilty to select existing avatar/character in the connection window.

Add way for admin account to make sure it moves its avatar in such a

Make common base for entity based layers.

Sort out windows so they are not deleted when the user clicks on close.

What NOW!?

No ideas. Semantic maps? tile maps? concentrate on apogee?
Is this all a bunch of arse?

Prabably best to try and get an editor which can edit and produce decent
tile maps, heightmaps, and entity maps.

How do we deal with heightmaps?
Should a heightmap be just another layer? If so, how to link it to
other layers? Map layers really need a common reference point for HeightMaps.
This could be a single layer which many heightfields, or a way of agregating
multiple layers.

Draw walking ant by using 1D texture, lined box, without depth test.
May have to copy to back buffer.

Investigate call of ->getID() on null pointer from ServerEntities.cpp:378

Fix cyphesis so the creator can perceive the world.

Fix move code so that it sets the ref correctly.

Pad out manipulation of entities, including moving and deleting. Resizing
can come later.

Switch to using drag and drop support in gtk-- to handle dragging.

Connection code, once complete needs custom op handler, which allows
construction of arbitrary ops. This window should allow selection of
various server subsystems as FROM of op, and also offer options for TO.

Add to the gimp interface.

Look into the possibility of a gimp like client lib for extensions.

Make a component which creates graphics for 2d client from 3d models.

Implement proper X dnd and selection using X primary selection and clipboard.

GlView is currently a total mess, half way to making a generic way of handling
all the mouse interactions. Need to generalise the drag calculating code
and then make sure things are correctly passed through to the layers for
processing. Drag code now generalised, and depth reading now works. Need
to make sure depth is not recalculated when finishing drag, as result can
be spurious at best.

Add to the gimp interface.

Look into the possibility of a gimp like client lib for extensions.

Sort out rendering order for layers.

Make a component which creates graphics for 2d client from 3d models.

Fix up Mercator point modification behavoir.

Implement the world size.

Implement terrain heightmaps as vertex array.

Parameterise the terrain heightmap code so it is no longer locked to 200x200.

Vision shift: Aim to create a useful tool for game developers generally.

Sort out the ui bugs. Think about how we should handle the terrain.
Re-work rendering options so that they work per-layer. This also applies to visibility
of layers, and probably layer order should be removed.

Sort out the ui bugs.

Add doted line to insert cursor to show its height.

Re-work the scrolling code so it scrolls round a dynamic world size, and
handles scrolling from the users perspective.

Make all the windows implement delete_event_impl() so they don't get deleted.

Add clipentry base class, which Layer classes have an associated derived
type to store stuff they copy and cut.

Add capabilty to select existing avatar/character in the connection window.

Add way for admin account to make sure it moves its avatar in such a
way that it gets appearance/disappearance ops.

Make common base for entity based layers.

Sort out windows so they are not deleted when the user clicks on close.

What NOW!?

No ideas. Semantic maps? tile maps? concentrate on apogee?
Is this all a bunch of arse?

Prabably best to try and get an editor which can edit and produce decent
tile maps, heightmaps, and entity maps.

Investigate call of ->getID() on null pointer from ServerEntities.cpp:378

Fix cyphesis so the creator can perceive the world.

Fix move code so that it sets the ref correctly.

Pad out manipulation of entities, including moving and deleting. Resizing
can come later.

Switch to using drag and drop support in gtk-- to handle dragging.

Connection code, once complete needs custom op handler, which allows
construction of arbitrary ops. This window should allow selection of
various server subsystems as FROM of op, and also offer options for TO.

Add to the gimp interface.

Look into the possibility of a gimp like client lib for extensions.

Make a component which creates graphics for 2d client from 3d models.

Implement proper X dnd and selection using X primary selection and clipboard.

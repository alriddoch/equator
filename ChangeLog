	* app/BladeMap.h, app/GlView.cpp, app/GlView.h, app/Holo.h,
	  app/IsoMap.h, app/Layer.h:
	  Added animate method to all layers. Call it regularly to
	  animate the view, and provide a cycling value between 0
	  and 1 to control cycling animations. Use the accumulation
	  buffer to store rendered frame once complete, and then overlay
	  animations onto stored frame to avoid having to re-render
	  when animating.

	* app/ServerEntities.h, app/ServerEntities.cpp: Use animation
	  mechanism to animate marching ants on selected entities.

	* ServerEntities.cpp/.h: Bind to various Eris signals, notably
	  EntiyCreate and Changed, to trigger a model update (and
	  hence a redraw) when server-driven changes occur. This
	  means movement and so on should be visible now.
	* Modified configure.in to check for ris and skstream using
	  the appropriate macros (AM_PATH_ERIS / AM_PATH_SKSTREAM)

	  is stored into a primary selection, selection list, and stack
	  of pushed primary selections. Implement selecting single entity
	  correctly, and pushing it onto the stack. Use stack to view

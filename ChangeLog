	* app/BladeMap.cpp, app/BladeMap.h, app/IsoMap.cpp, app/IsoMap.h,
	  app/Holo.h, app/Layer.h:
	  Implement depth buffer use in map drawing. Implement select code to
	  check whether this layer, or a selected proportion of this layer
	  has been clicked on. Set the name of the layer according to the
	  map that has been loaded into it. Add support for moving the
	  whole layer around relative to the origin.

	* app/GlView.cpp:
	  Ensure that zooming beyond the zoom limits does not cause CPU
	  thrashing. Implement more generic interface for dragging, and
	  use it to implement panning, and dragging of layers, using the
	  tools in the main window.

	* app/LayerWindow.cpp: Set minimum size to something sensible.

	* app/MainWindow.cpp, app/MainWindow.h:
	  Make all the tool buttons toggle, and implement radio button
	  behavoir. Expose the selected tool so it can be used by the view
	  code.

	* app/BladeMap.cpp, app/BladeMap.h, app/Holo.cpp, app/Holo.h,
	  app/IsoMap.cpp, app/IsoMap.h, app/Layer.h: Make layer's reference
	  to GlView non-const so that layers can minupulate the view.

	* app/GlView.cpp, app/GlView.h: Implemented dragging, allowing
	  the user to move around the view.

	* app/equator_plugin.cpp: Made plugin functionality optional, so
	  app will still build and run if gimp is not installed.

	  Added support for selection by clicking, or dragging a box round
	  objects.

	* app/BladeMap.cpp, app/BladeMap.h, app/GlView.cpp, app/Holo.h,
	  app/IsoMap.cpp, app/IsoMap.h:
	  Made file loading only happen if the user requests it.

	* app/GlView.cpp, app/GlView.h:
	  Added selection interface, and utility function that can be used
	  to set up the projection for picking.

	* app/GlView.cpp, app/GlView.h:
	  Implemented re-ordering of layers, and made sure layer order is
	  intuitive.

	* app/Holo.cpp:
	  Tweaked to ensure the grid is drawn with or without depth testing
	  on.

	* app/LayerWindow.cpp, app/LayerWindow.h:
	  Added graphics for the layer buttons, and implemented manipulating
	  order of layers.

2001-12-06  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* app/LayerWindow.cpp: Sorted out packing of optionmenu.

	* app/MainWindow.cpp: Add some more button graphics.

2001-12-06  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* app/equator_plugin.cpp: New version of main function and
	  related code which enables equator to be launched as a gimp
	  extension, and this grant it access to gimps features.

	* app/IsoMap.cpp: Get rid of far corner of tile, as it is of no
	  relevance.

	* app/LayerWindow.h, app/LayerWindow.cpp: Add an option menu to
	  select which view this applies to. Connect to mainwindow signal
	  which informs is when a new view is created, and use this info
	  to create a menu list.

	* app/MainWindow.cpp, app/MainWindow.h: Added a signal to inform any

	  for handling connections to servers.

	* app/inheritance.cpp, app/inheritance.h, app/operations.h:
	  Code to handle storing information about operation definitions
	  and entity classes.

	* app/IsoMap.cpp, app/Texture.cpp, app/Texture.h: Add code to handle
	  iso tiles as textures. Use this to render Iso maps.

	* app/LayerWindow.cpp: Make this window non-sensitive when there
	  are no views.
